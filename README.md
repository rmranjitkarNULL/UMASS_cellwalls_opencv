# UMASS Summer Labs - Cell identification using OpenCV

This project was developed as part of the UMASS Summer Labs program and focuses on applying computer vision techniques to identify and analyze cells in microscopic images. Using Python and OpenCV, the system detects cell boundaries, counts cells, and extracts morphological features to assist in biological research and quantitative analysis.

Libraries Used

    OpenCV

    NumPy

    Matplotlib (for visualization)

# Getting Started:

Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/cell-identification-opencv.git```

Navigate to directory

```cd cell-identification-opencv```

Install dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Run the script

```python cell_identifier.py --image path_to_image```

This project works with high-resolution images of stained cells captured under a microscope. Publicly available datasets or custom image sets (.png, .jpg) can be used as input.
Sample Output

Include an example image or visualization here to demonstrate detection results.

# Example command
```python cell_identifier.py --image sample_images/cell_sample_01.png```

# Future Improvements
    Lighting Balance

    GUI development for non-technical users
